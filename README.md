# 🤖 RAG Chatbot using Transformers & Streamlit

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot** built during my **Data Science training**.

The application retrieves relevant information from an internal knowledge base using **sentence embeddings**, and then generates answers using a **large language model**.

---

## 🧠 How It Works
1. User enters a question
2. Question is converted into an embedding
3. Most relevant documents are retrieved using cosine similarity
4. Retrieved context is passed to an LLM
5. LLM generates an answer grounded in retrieved context
